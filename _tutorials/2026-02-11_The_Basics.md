## Overview

In this Live Draw session, we'll tackle one of the most challenging aspects of character art: **dynamic poses**. Whether you're drawing superheroes, saints, or Joe Catholic dodging temporal anomalies, understanding how to capture movement and energy in a static drawing is essential.

## What We'll Cover

This tutorial breaks down the fundamentals of gesture drawing and shows you how to:

- Find the "line of action" that drives your pose
- Balance your character's weight realistically
- Use reference photos without copying them slavishly
- Add energy and personality through exaggeration
