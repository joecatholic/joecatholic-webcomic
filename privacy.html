        <p>This site is operated by <strong>Fr. Chris Decker</strong> through <strong>Collarmark Productions</strong>. It is a personal creative site hosting the <em>Joe Catholic</em> webcomic and drawing tutorials. We are not a corporation, we do not sell advertising, and we do not sell your personal data — full stop.</p>

        <p>This policy explains what data is collected, by whom, and what your choices are.</p>

        <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Site operator:</strong> Fr. Chris Decker / Collarmark Productions<br>
            <strong>Website:</strong> joecatholic.com<br>
            <strong>Contact:</strong> Use the contact form on the <a href="/about">About page</a>
        </p>
        <p>This site is hosted on <strong>Netlify</strong> (San Francisco, CA, USA). Netlify may log standard server access data (IP address, browser type, pages visited, timestamps) as part of normal hosting operations. See <a href="https://www.netlify.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netlify's Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

        <hr class="privacy-divider">

        <h2>2. Data We Collect Directly</h2>
        <p>We collect <strong>no personal data directly</strong>. There is no account system, no contact form that stores submissions, and no email list managed through this site.</p>
        <p>The only data stored on your device is:</p>
        <ul class="privacy-list">
            <li><strong>Your cookie preferences</strong> — so we don't ask every visit (stored in <code>localStorage</code> as <code>jc_cookie_consent</code>)</li>
            <li><strong>Your comic bookmark</strong> — if you choose to use it (stored in <code>localStorage</code> as <code>jc_bookmark</code>). This never leaves your browser.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both are stored only in your browser's <code>localStorage</code>. They are never transmitted to any server, never shared with any third party, and are fully under your control. You can clear them at any time through your browser settings or by using the <button onclick="showCookieBanner()" class="privacy-inline-btn">Cookie Preferences</button> panel.</p>

        <hr class="privacy-divider">

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>This site links to or embeds content from the following third-party services. Each has its own privacy policy and may set cookies or collect data when you interact with them.</p>

        <div class="privacy-third-party">

            <div class="privacy-service">
                <h3>YouTube (Google LLC)</h3>
                <p><strong>Used for:</strong> Embedded tutorial videos on the Tutorials section.</p>
                <p><strong>What it does:</strong> We use YouTube's <em>privacy-enhanced mode</em> (<code>youtube-nocookie.com</code>). In this mode, YouTube does not set tracking cookies until you actively click to play a video. Once you play a video, Google/YouTube may set cookies and collect viewing data per their standard policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Your control:</strong> You can decline YouTube cookies in our <button onclick="showCookieBanner()" class="privacy-inline-btn">Cookie Preferences</button> panel. If declined, videos will not autoload — you can still watch them directly on YouTube.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="privacy-service">
                <h3>Amazon</h3>
                <p><strong>Used for:</strong> Links to purchase the <em>Joe Catholic Episode 1</em> book.</p>
                <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Clicking an Amazon link takes you to Amazon's website. Amazon may set cookies on their site per their own policies. We do not currently participate in the Amazon Associates affiliate program, so no commission tracking is attached to these links.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468496" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Privacy Notice →</a></p>

            <div class="privacy-service">
                <h3>Ko-fi</h3>
                <p><strong>Used for:</strong> A link in the site footer to support the creator.</p>
                <p><strong>What it does:</strong> The footer contains a link to Ko-fi. No Ko-fi widgets are embedded on this site — clicking the link simply navigates to Ko-fi's website.</p>

                <h3>X (Twitter)</h3>
                <p><strong>Used for:</strong> A link in the site footer to the @joecatholicart account.</p>
                <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Footer link only — no X/Twitter widgets or embeds are present on this site.</p>

        <h2>4. Analytics</h2>
        <p>This site does <strong>not currently use any analytics service</strong> (no Google Analytics, no Netlify Analytics, no tracking pixels). If this changes in the future, this policy will be updated and your consent will be requested through the Cookie Preferences panel before any tracking begins.</p>

        <hr class="privacy-divider">

        <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on where you live, you may have rights regarding your personal data under laws such as the GDPR (EU/EEA), UK GDPR, or CCPA (California). Because this site collects no personal data directly, most of these rights are not practically applicable here. However:</p>
        <ul class="privacy-list">
            <li>You can <strong>view and delete</strong> any locally stored data (bookmarks, preferences) through your browser's developer tools or storage settings.</li>
            <li>You can <strong>change your cookie preferences</strong> at any time using the <button onclick="showCookieBanner()" class="privacy-inline-btn">Cookie Preferences</button> button.</li>
            <li>For any concerns, you may contact us via the <a href="/about">About page</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr class="privacy-divider">

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>This site is intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect any data from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information through this site, please contact us and we will address it promptly.</p>

        <hr class="privacy-divider">

        <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>If we make significant changes to this policy, the "Last updated" date at the top will change and the cookie consent version will be incremented — meaning returning visitors will be shown the consent banner again.</p>

        <hr class="privacy-divider">

        <p class="privacy-footer-note">This site is a labor of love for the Catholic community. Thank you for reading, and God bless. 🙏</p>
