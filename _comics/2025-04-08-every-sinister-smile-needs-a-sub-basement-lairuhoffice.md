Here we see the first glimpses that Abendroth’s smirk may be up to no good. You get points if you can tell me what the second panel “sub-basement” shot is based on. (Hint: It’s one of my favorite movies!)

Also, we see the book “Gratiarum” … it means “Graces” in Latin. Why would he be reading up on grace? And what are those red whisps?!
