Having been to The Holy Land once, I was surprised at how lush things were. The Scriptures often speak of the desert and wilderness interchangeably. While there are barren places, the wilderness usually has some form of tree or shrub growing. I may have gotten carried away with the palms, when I should have added in some olive groves. But, the palms are so fun to draw!
