Hi there! Welcome to what is the re-re-re-reboot of an idea I've had in my head in one form or another for decades. (Gosh, decades?!).  Well, Joe Catholic's first appearance happened on notebook paper in my first semester in the seminary, so that’s over 25 years ago. Wow.

Joe Catholic is an homage to the swashbuckling of Indiana Jones, the adventure of Uncle Scrooge (my favorite Comic as a kid), and the quasi sci-fi of Flash Gordon. Toss in a little Tintin for extra measure and you've got Joe Catholic: a college kid with a penchant for being mostly average, until something happens that may change the trajectory of his life for eternity!

I hope you enjoy this first episode as it unfolds and learn a bit about some of the more interesting bits of Catholic catechism and history. You can find some of my alternative Joe Catholic full-page catechism pages (and some of my other work) here.

Onward!
