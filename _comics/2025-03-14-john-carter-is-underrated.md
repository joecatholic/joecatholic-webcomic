I was trying to figure out what it would sound like when Joe does whatever this shifting thing is. I think this is the sound it would make.

And if you’re wondering who John Carter is, don’t let the Disney film fool ya. It was excellent proto-sci-fi from a bygone age. Edgar Rice Burroughs has an excellent imagination that you can read a century later. His first adventure with John Carter was A Princess of Mars.

Here’s a bit from the foreword:

“When the war broke out he left us, nor did I see him again for some fifteen or sixteen years. When he returned it was without warning, and I was much surprised to note that he had not aged apparently a moment, nor had he changed in any other outward way. He was, when others were with him, the same genial, happy fellow we had known of old, but when he thought himself alone I have seen him sit for hours gazing off into space, his face set in a look of wistful longing and hopeless misery; and at night he would sit thus looking up into the heavens, at what I did not know until I read his manuscript years afterward.“
