You might notice that the date stamp on the comic itself reads 2023. This particular storyline is nearly two years old. I began to draw with this as the original starting issue. I added the “prologue” before this comic to give it more of a cold open quality since three panels of a sleeping main character seemed to me to invite you to yawn along with Joe (and possibly never return!)

But, fear not! After three years, I think I’m happy with where the story unfolds. And in the next issue, the plot thickens…with sand. Stay tuned!
