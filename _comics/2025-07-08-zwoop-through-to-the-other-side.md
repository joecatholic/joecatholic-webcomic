Well, seeing as it’s my birthday, I suppose I should update my comic! Here we get a nice plot-point. Abendroth doesn’t have the ability to touch or interact with things or people when he shifts. My thinking is that he’s working with a twisted version of agility, so it’s a limitation even though it is a spectacle.
