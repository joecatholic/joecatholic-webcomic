I have to say, that even drawing a completely fictitious comic strip that takes place in “the real world” that going to The Holy Land has really given some incredible scale to my imagination. It’s amazing at how one can see how relatively small the places that Our Lord saw and encountered, as well as the lands that Moses and the Israelites traversed. It’s also possible to see how big they would have been to someone who travelled primarily on foot. Perhaps we’ll get to explore these locales a bit here. Maybe we’ll visit the temple (and everything)!
