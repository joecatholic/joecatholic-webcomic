Usually, when I pray with the Scriptures, I tend to use the New Revised Standard Version (Catholic Edition), although I also enjoy the Knox Translation, compiled by Msgr. Ronald Knox, who “…wanted a Bible that did not merely translate the original but made it read as if an Englishman had written it. His translation is spiritual and literary, graceful and lyrical, making it one of the most beautiful vernacular versions of the Holy Bible.” You might want to check it out!
