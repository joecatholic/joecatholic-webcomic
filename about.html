            <h2>Joe Catholic</h2>
            <p>Joe Catholic's a college kid at The University of St. Thomas the Apostle. He's clumsy, scrappy-yet-chivalrous, and prone to yawning through Mass&mdash;until something strange starts yanking him places he can't explain. A restless spark drives him, hinting at a bigger game he's only starting to glimpse. With his crew at his back, he's stumbling into shadows that don't play nice&mdash;ready or not.</p>

            <h2>Giovanni DeLuca</h2>
            <p>Giovanni DeLuca's Joe's loudmouth shadow at USTA&mdash;always ready with a jab or a shove when things get weird. He's got no fancy tricks, just guts and a nose for trouble he can't ignore. Something's pulling his best pal into deep waters, and he's diving in&mdash;clueless but all in.</p>

            <h2>Fr. Gabriel Nard, FST</h2>
            <p>Fr. Gabriel Nard is a priest of the Fraternity of Saint Thomas haunting USTA's halls&mdash;old-school, stern, with secrets tucked in his habit. He's got a past that whispers of bigger fights and a book that doesn't belong in anyone's hands. When the dark creeps in, he's the one pointing Joe at it&mdash;whether Joe likes it or not.</p>

            <h2>Elise Moreau</h2>
            <p>Elise Moreau lurks in USTA's library stacks&mdash;quiet, watchful, with eyes that catch more than dust motes. She's got a knack for sensing what's off, a flicker of something golden when trouble brews. Whatever she's hiding, she's tied to Joe's mess now&mdash;stepping out when it counts.</p>

            <p>Heinrich Abendroth's a smooth-talking phantom from the Church's edges. He's an ex-priest with a grin that cuts too deep. He's chasing something big, something about time and power, and he's got Joe in his sights. Whatever he's plotting, it's bad news&mdash;and he's not done yet.</p>
